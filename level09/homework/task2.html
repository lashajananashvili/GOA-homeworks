<h1><em><b>Python</b></em></h1>
<p><b>is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.</b> Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.<br>
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard
Guido van Rossum began working on <b>python in the late 1980s</b><br> as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. <b>Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions.</b>
<br> Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.python is use </p>

<h1><em><b>HTML</b></em></h1>
<P><b>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) </b>is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. <br>
It is often assisted by technologies such as <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b>  and scripting languages such as JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server <br>
or from local storage and render the documents into <b>multimedia web pages</b>. <b>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally</b> included cues for its appearance.</P>

<h1><em><b>C++</b></em></h1>

<p>C++ is a <b>high-level, general-purpose programming language</b> created by <b>Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup</b>. <b>First released in 1985</b>  as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; as of 1997, 
<b>C++ has object-oriented,</b> generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation for making things like microcomputers or to make operating systems like Linux or Windows.
It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide <b>>C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation</b> LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.[14]</p>

<h1><em><b>PASCAL</b></em></h1>
<p>Pascal is an imperative and procedural programming language, designed by <b> Niklaus Wirth</b> as a small, efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices <b> using 
structured programming and data structuring.</b> It is named after <b>French mathematician, philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal</b>.Pascal was developed on the pattern of the ALGOL 60 language. 
Wirth was involved in the process to improve the language as part of the <b>ALGOL</b>  X efforts and proposed a version named ALGOL <b> This was not accepted, and the ALGOL X process bogged down.</b>
<b>In 1968</b>, Wirth decided to abandon the ALGOL X process and further improve ALGOL W, <b> releasing this as Pascal in 1970.</b></p>

<h1><em><b>JAVA</b></em></h1>
<p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming <b>language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.</b> It is a general-purpose programming 
language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere <b>meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java</b>  without the need to recompile
it was designed by 	<b>James Gosling and developed by Oracle Corporation</b> it first apeared in <b>29 years ago in 1995.</b>  java was released as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The initial version,
known as <b>Java 1.0</b>, provided the foundation for the widespread adoption and evolution of the Java programming language and platform.</p>

<h1><em><b>JavaScript</b></em></h1>

<p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a <b>programming language</b> and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and <b>CSS.99%</b> of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.
<b>Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine</b> that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for
non-browser usage is <b> Node.js.</b> JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich while he was working at <b>Netscape Communications Corporation.</b>  Eich developed JavaScript
<b>in just 10 days in May 1995,</b> originally under the name <b>Mocha</b> , then renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript. The language was designed to make web pages interactive.
and is now a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
